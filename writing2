CELEBRATE THEM WHILE ALIVE
I feel sad about the loss and those who lost their loved ones in the Ethiopian Airlines tragedy. I beseech God grant you the strength to stay strong and bear the miserable experience. Nobody on this side of the earth will live forever as we all ought to live ready.
A young Professor died in the crash learnt touched lives academically; if to mention just one! But, it's pathetic that none of these people celebrate him much while he was alive.
I became to recognise him when I noticed unusual memo and post which made me check my friend's list to discover we have several mutual friends. Some of them never share his post or article on their timeline.
The major objective of social media is to set up a community where we relate and create mutual bonds. You don't stick around until something terrible happens or when you perceive a personality won an election to claim familiarity.
There are some people who have never like or share "post" of someone they state to be in their friend's list; can I call it ego or claim you are that busy, even the regular Happy Birthday is a no?
All these are not for decorations. Try to demonstrate love and appreciate every little things regardless your status or whatever you try to show off.
God rest the souls of the faithful departed.
We will finish well and strongâ€¦
Celebrate them while alive!
